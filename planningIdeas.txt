How does a game of connect 4 work?

Connect Four is played on a grid. 
7 Wide by 6 deep. 7 x 6

2 players, (red and blue)
Alternating turns droppoing a piece of colour into the top of each column.
The piece will fall to the first unoccupied slot.

The game is won when a play makes four in a row,
Horizontally, vertically or diagonally.
The game is tied if the board is full and no winner. 

Planning:

What HTML would be useful for the game itself?
A HTML table?

"The HTML table model allows authors to arrange
 data -- text, preformatted text, images,
links, forms, form fields, other tables, etc. -- into rows
and columns of cells. Each table may have an associated caption
anndsee the CAPTION element) that provides a short description of the table's purpose."

A list of <div> elements?
Also possible.

how could you represent a played-piece in the HTML board?
let pieces = document.getElementsbyClass('piece') //nodelist
